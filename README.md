## Introduction
In the last two weeks of my time with the Tech Academy, I worked with a team to develop a full scale Code First MVC Web Application in C#. 
Working on a legacy application gave me a great learning oppertunity to work out existing bugs, creating new elements, and adding completely new 
features to make the web application better as well as a more positive user experience. We delivered all needed changes in a timely fashion and met our 2 
week deadline. In my experience with the team I learned how a good software developer works in a team setting, and there were many examples of 
great leadership from the instructors. I worked on several stories both front-end and back-end, and I am very proud of my code accomplishments. 
Everyone on the team had the chance to work on stories in both front/back-end of various difficulty levels. My final story was of a high level 
of difficulty and I am the most proud of that work. I'm confident I will use the skills I learned that are featured here for many years to come.
