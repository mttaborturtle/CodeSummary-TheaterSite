## Introduction
In my last two weeks of my experience with the Tech Academy, I worked with a team to develop a full scale Code First MVC Web Application in C#. 
Working on a legacy application gave me a great learning oppertunity to work out existing bugs, creating new elements, and adding completely new 
features to make the web application better and more positive user experience. We delivered all needed changed in a timely fasion and met our 2 
week deadlines. In my experience with the team I learned how a good software developer worked in a team setting and there were many examples of 
great leadership from the instructors. I worked on several stories both front-end and back-end, and I am very proud of my code accomplishments. 
Everyone on the team had the chance to work on stories in both front/back-end of various difficulty levels. My final story was of a high level 
of difficulty and I am the most proud of that work. I'm confident I will use the skills I learned that are featured here for many years to come.
